Welcome to an HPC.social blog! We have several blogs that are scoped to different groupings in our community, and this one in particular is scoped
to the following:

>  This is content from people who represent projects, ecosystems, or governance boards that talk about specific community interested content around the work they represent. The content range from release notes, tricks and tips, discussion around tooling and infrastructure, and other things that are neutrally branded. Discussion of branded topics like CUDA, SYCL, and oneAPI are ok - discussions about hardware are ok. Product announcements are not ok especially.

The hpc.social community blogs aim to share ideas, news, and stories from diverse people, centers and groups across the High Performance Computing (HPC) community.
Whether you are an advanced practitioner, a developer that touches HPC, or a novice, your voice is welcome here. This community blog reflects exactly that - a syndicated feed of our community voices. It's one places that you can subscribe to via a variety of channels (below) and also <a href="https://github.com/hpc-social/community-blog" target="_blank">follow instructions to contribute your own feed</a>.

As a word of caution, we curate authors at the point of adding the blog, but do not regularly curate individual posts that are added nightly via automation. The opinions expressed here are owned by the authors and do not reflect the opinion of the hpc.social community at large. Offensive or inappropriate posts should be reported to [info@hpc.social](mailto:info@hpc.social) if you wish to report anonymously. You can also submit a pull request to remove the offending feed if you are comfortable doing so publicly.
