<p>One of the ways that I feel we should engage when building community for<br />
a relatively new ecosystem like oneAPI is the ability to showcase it's<br />
capabilities. We know that AI especially generative AI have captured<br />
the hearts and minds of many especially being able to build interesting<br />
visuals using prompts. As well, GPU offloading, and learning algorithms<br />
also have gained traction in this space as well.</p>


<p>We talk about the <a href="https://www.turing.com/kb/ultimate-guide-to-democratization-in-ai">democratization of<br />
AI</a><br />
and its important in the emerging new chapter of AI. There is no better<br />
time and greater need to build things on an open spec'd platform where<br />
it's clear what is going and out and that the conversations are public,<br />
the decisions are public.</p>


<p>An open spec'd platform is no good if it doesn't show<br />
<em>utility</em>. Developers aren't going to consume your platform if you<br />
cannot show viability, ease of use, and performance. So to show utility,<br />
we worked on building a curated list of projects that show examples of<br />
the utility of oneAPI, but also provide projects that are worth spending<br />
time being part of. Some of these projects might surprise you in that<br />
they use oneAPI like Blender.</p>


<p>Some of you might have heard of the 'awesome' lists<br />
concept which are lists of github repos that are great<br />
examples of using that subject matter. For instance, <a href="https://github.com/bharathgs/Awesome-pytorch-list">Awesome<br />
Pytorch</a> is a good<br />
example of a list that shows cool projects that use pytorch. The list<br />
is meant to be simple, developer friendly, and easy to navigate.</p>


<p>We were inspired by these lists as they seem like a great way to find your<br />
way to good projects. So we created our own 'awesome' list of projects<br />
for SYCL and oneAPI. So without further ado, feel free to check out<br />
<a href="https://github.com/oneapi-community/awesome-oneapi">awesome oneAPI</a>. We<br />
would of course love feedback and if you have projects that might fit<br />
this list, please fork and submit a PR! Questions are welcome, you can<br />
