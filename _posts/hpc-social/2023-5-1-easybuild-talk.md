<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://github.com/alansill">Alan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vsoch">vsoch</a>
presented the hpc.social at the annual EasyBuild Userâ€™s meeting:</p>




<p>In this talk they share the origins of the project, the current project, and
prompt for questions or ideas about desire for the future. As a result of the talk,
the <a href="https://hpc.social/events/">hpc.social events</a> page has already been refactored
to properly show the HPC Huddle community feed, and other communities that have ical
feeds are welcome to contribute their event feeds there.</p>
